# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
CPU: Minimum 6 cores (Ryzen 5/Intel i5 and above, best 8 cores)
GPU: Minimum 4GB VRAM (best 8GB VRAM)
RAM: 16GB (best 32GB RAM if you would like to do interpolation to higher framerate such as 1000, 2000 etc.)

# BEST CODEC TO USE

H264 is the most preferred codec to use. X264/X265 are known to be slow at processing higher framerate videos and they are not recommended in most cases. For the best experience, use a higher-end GPU like an GTX 1070/RX 5700 XT and above.

Maximum resolution for each codec:
H264/X264: 4K,
H265/X265: 8K
